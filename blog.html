                        <legend> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT  </legend>
                        Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every       
                        business plan. From multinational corporations who maintain mainframe 
                        systems and databases to small businesses that own a single computer.
                        The purpose of IT is to improve the productivity of the organisation by using 
                        differents technologies.<br> 
                        Technology can be used to protect financial data, confidential executive 
                        decisions and other proprietary information that leads to competitive  
                        advantages : Maintaining data in a stable and secure state.<br>
                        IT must be in the driver’s seat of technology, for a number of reasons, including risks 
                        like cyber-attacks, integrity of the systems, but most importantly, the purpose of IT is 
                        to enable the business, to drive new opportunities and open new avenues through 
                        innovations and increased efficiencies. If IT, from the CIO down, is not constantly working with the CMO or business leaders, IT is not living up to its purpose.

                    <legend> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources   </legend>
                    The more effort you put into thinking through the types of project resources you need and requesting them far enough
                    in advance to ensure that they are ready for you when you need them, the easier it will be for you to complete your
                    project on time, on budget and to the required specifications.<br><br>
                    The lack of a resource will therefore be a constraint on the completion of the project activity
                    These resources can be  people, equipement, facilities or anything required for a completion of a project activity.
                    <br><br>a ) Methods :
                    There are many methods available on the market  to complete an IT 
                    project  successfully: Agile, Waterfall, Prince2, Extreme Programming (XP) 
                    The key factor to determine the right methodology is the type of 
                    project or process that you manage. With a vast array of frameworks 
                    and methodologies, narrowing down the approach based on specific    
                    criteria is critical. These factors include:  <br><br>      
        
                    - Customer and stakeholder involvement.<br>
                    - Industry.<br>
                    - Flexibility of timeline.<br>
                    - Allotted budget.<br>
                    - Number and type of teams working on the project.<br>
                    - Complexity of projects.<br>
                    - Resources needed versus resources available.<br>
                    <br>b ) Skills:  
                    To complete IT project successfully we need some skills like : Communicate clearly and have a good understanding of the problem,planning is also a critical skills that led our project to the success and analytical skills which mean how to collect and analyse information and take a good decision.

                <fieldset><!-- Describing the risk -->
                    <legend> 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects  </legend>
                    <br>a)Poorly defined (or no defined) outcome.
                    The more common problems  is an ill defined goal or outcome. A company will say they want to improve customer service  but no one ever bothers to say what that looks like. If you don’t know, you’re doomed to failure.<br>
                    <br>b) Lack of accountability.
                    When projects are dubbed “IT projects” and left to the IT department, there’s also a lack of accountability that can develop. Executives may wrongly believe that they can’t understand what’s happening, and leave it to the tech guys to figure out. This is a mistake. If your tech team can’t adequately explain what’s happening on the project or why it’s needed, that’s a huge red flag. And if the executives aren’t driving the project and holding the team accountable, it can easily spiral out of control.<br>
                    <br>c) Insufficient communication.
                    It’s vital for someone on the team to have strong visualization and storytelling skills in order to communicate clearly and regularly what’s happening with the project.<br> 
                    <br>d) No plan or timeline.
                    Without a clear timeline and plan with progress markers, any project (but technology projects in particular) can wander off the original path and meander through many detours and cul du sacs. A clear plan and someone to keep track of it is vital for keeping these projects moving forward.<br> 
                    <br>e) Lack of user testing, or failure to address feedback.
                    The thing about technology projects is that ultimately, they’re made for people, not machines. A lack of real-world user testing before launch is a common problem. The data scientists, programmers and engineers think they know what users want, but users may have an entirely different set of needs and problems. Once user testing is conducted, the project has to prioritize addressing the feedback, or the end user won’t be happy — and ultimately won’t use the technology created for them.<br>
                   <br>f) Solving the wrong problem.
                    Sometimes the  company think they’re creating something to address the problem, but it turns out they’re addressing the wrong problem.<br>

                    <legend> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </legend>
                    Whenever you want to build a product from scratch, the best option is to go with the easiest solution.In our case the projects limited to run on client side so we can limited  the software on HTML, CSS and javaScript as the browser can interpret these technologies., that means we don’t have to worry about languages that run on server side such as Java, Python, PHP ….
                    We  will use Visual studio as IDE and IOS as operating system.

                    <legend> 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.  </legend>
                    To begin with, HTML,CSS and javaScrip[t are necessary and we can't imagine developing a website without using these technologies.
                    All the desing was made by HTML  that means the structure of my pages  are designed by html and the decorations and colors are made by CSS file which is linked to my html file,  I also use a javaScript file  to change language on the dropdown list . All tasks was described in Trello with datails in order to have a good logic analysis of application.

                <fieldset><!-- Describing constraint  -->
                    <legend> 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that  impact digital projects  </legend>
                    A project is often defined as successful if the project’s objectives are achieved by the deadline and within the budget.However there are some constraint that affect the project to be achieved as we expect.
                    Risk : For example if for one reason we skip the client-view because we are late, if so there is a risk that the client reject the project or a part of the project.<br><br>
                    Resources are strongly connected to the project cost.The amount of money that is available for achieving the desired project will restrict the use and acquisition of resources which create  a significative constraint.
                    Methodology : The choice of a methode scrum, agile etc can have a risk on the project development process for example with scrum it is simple to use but it required daily meeting and get plenty of review whereas with agile it is hard to estimate the time upfront so there is a risk of missing the deadline.
                    Customer satisfaction : If the project’s cost becomes higher than we expect, perhaps we will sacrifice the client satisfaction, in the end client satisfaction will highly affect the project success.<br><br>
                   It’s crucial to know the different constraints of a project. The only way to control them is to understand them. So when making important decisions, don’t just consider time, scope, and budget, but also factor in quality, risk, resources, methodology and customer satisfaction.

                    Yes I am happy with the tools that I have used , trello program helped me to describe  and schedule all tasks that i need but as It 's the first time i use program like trello i can't make comparaison with other program.Slack is a good program to excange communication and message with collegues.vsCode is easy to use the only c hallenge that i find sometimes is to manipulate different screens as i never use mac before but now i have a good idea for this operatiin system. .

                    To achioeve my projkect I use differents tools  the IDE vsCode that allow to code different pages  in HTML, CVSS and js .This tools is approprite because i have access to all files in the same place and I can navigate easily between pages.Also to make update I use vsCode .Other tools that I use is  Trello that helps me to design the structure of my website and  plan all tasks to do.Iuse slack to ge ideas  with other students . To publish my website I used GitHub.

                    The strengths points is that the website I use javascript to control and check the drop[ down list used in the menu the user can choose only the options rpovided , also I used BootSyrap to make the website responsive but I applied this tyechnology only on the first page for the footyer as I have just start to learn about Bootstrap and I don't master yet this technology.

                    The most important  improvement I can make is to add responsive functionality. vfor the entire website.I have just started to learn about Bootstrap and i applied it just for the fouter( welcom to my websit). It works perfectly but I don't have time to make all my website resposnsive to use it in mobile without issuues.An other point is I can make my website very easy to use by all people I mean by that people with disabilikties .

In my case I limit my work only on the client side but we could use others files  such as .php or .py these files can run on the server side. <br>
